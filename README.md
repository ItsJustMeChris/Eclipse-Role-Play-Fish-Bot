Deprecated and ugly/thrown together code..
Updated version of fish bot ported to GTA World, recommeneded to backport that version instead as it removes the 1920x1080 requirement. 


--This bot was thrown together to get something that worked, felt lazy when writing it but went over and have redone a lot of it to make it prettier, may post update when I have time to..
# Eclipse-Role-Play-Fish-Bot
This is a pixel based fish bot for Eclipse Role Play GTA5 server, supports only 1920x1080 right now
